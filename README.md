# Kavita Webview
An application that just uses a Webview to wrap Kavita for reading, but with gesture and hotkey support as well as other quality of life.

## Why?
Installing Key mapping tools to bind certain actions to other actions was tedious and most of the time they did not offer exactly what I needed. 

I just want to be able to read Kavita like other ereader applications, and that is mostly swipe or physical buttons to turn pages.

I made this Webview because I wanted something simple, easy, and wouldn't break if Kavita changes. (I am playing around in a separate project on an actual Kavita reader using the Kavita API, but it's a lot more work)

## What?
I've added the following actions that can be bindable so far:

| Rebindable Actions/Buttons |
| -------- |
| Volume Up  |
| Volume Down |
| Swipe Up |
| Swipe Down |
| Swipe Left |
| Swipe Right |
| Double Tap Top (12 o'clock) |
| Double Tap Bottom (6 o'clock) |
| Double Tap Left (9 o'clock) |
| Double Tap Right (3 o'clock) |

| Bindable Actions |
| -------- |
| None (Disabled)  |
| Page Up |
| Page Down |
| Up Arrow |
| Down Arrow |
| Left Arrow |
| Right Arrow |

# Other Quality of Life
- Hide Status/Navigation Bar
- Disable Text Selection

*These are Keyboard bindings, similar to using a keyboard on the device.
